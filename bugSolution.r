```r
# Solution: Use a data type that can handle larger numbers, such as a double-precision floating point number.

# Define a very large integer
large_number <- 2^63

# Convert to double to prevent overflow
large_number_double <- as.numeric(large_number)

# Add 1 safely
result <- large_number_double + 1

print(result)
